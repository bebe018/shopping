# Prerequisites
1. [Python â‰¥ 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
3. Install required python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Go to lines 30 and replace the e-mail username and password with yours in modules/reset_password_email.py: (If you don't use gmail, then you must edit lines 29 to your SMTP hostname and port too.)
    
    # Send the message via SMTP server.
    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465) as server:
        server.login("Your e-mail address", "Your application password") 
        <!-- (p.s the application password please check the link below https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=zh-Hant)
        server.send_message(message) -->
    
5. Go to lines 23 and replace the secret key with yours in shopping.py:<br />
    5.1 Lines 23 in shopping.py:
    
    # set up the secret key to save session
    shopping.secret_key = 'Secret key'
    
    5.2 How to generate a nice secret key:
    
    >>> import secrets
    >>> secrets.token_urlsafe(16)
        for example the key will like 'n2LzE3WSktAQua3EqwAX6A'
